Requirements
==================================
The packages build-essential and matplotlib.


Introduction
==================================
IBM_GUI is a graphical interface, which allows the study of the dynamics of an infectious disease 
spread using compartmental models in combination with complex networks. This interface aims at 
considering stochastic factors that govern the evolution of an infection in a network. Moreover, 
it provides simple tools to create networks of individuals and define the epidemiological parameters
of outbreaks. There are six common infectious disease models (SI, SIS, SIR, SIRS, SEIR and SEIRS) or
a user can provide another model, combining compartments. Moreover, in the simulations the user can
either include a synthetic network generated according to a network model (random, small-world,
scale-free, modular, and hierarchical) or a real network. This approach can help understand the paths
followed by outbreaks in a given community and design new strategies to prevent and control them.


Installation
